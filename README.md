ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Friday Joshua â€” a passionate Software Engineer, Tech Educator, Digital Marketer, and UI/UX Designer.

ðŸ’» I build scalable web applications with modern tech stacks like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, and Iâ€™m deeply committed to clean code, intuitive design, and impactful user experiences.

ðŸ“š As a tech educator, I love simplifying complex concepts and empowering aspiring developers through hands-on projects and community-driven learning.

ðŸ“ˆ I blend tech and marketing to help businesses grow with smart, data-driven digital strategies.

ðŸŽ¨ Whether itâ€™s crafting beautiful UIs or architecting robust backends, Iâ€™m always exploring the sweet spot between functionality and design.

ðŸš€ Currently working on a SaaS platform to help junior developers build real-world projects and level up their skills.

Let's connect and collaborate! âš¡
